## Integration Instructions

### 1. Using the HistoryPage Component
To use the new HistoryPage component, import it in your App.svelte or routing component:

```svelte
import HistoryPage from './components/HistoryPage.svelte';
```

Then use it in your template:

```svelte
<HistoryPage onBack={handleBack} onSettings={handleSettings} />
```

### 2. Replacing Existing History Component
To replace the existing History.svelte component with the new implementation:

1. In your main App.svelte or routing component, replace imports of History.svelte with HistoryPage.svelte
2. Update the component usage to pass the required props (onBack, onSettings)

### 3. Data Integration
The current implementation uses mock data. To integrate with real data:

1. Modify HistoryPage.svelte to load data from your existing data source (localStorage, API, etc.)
2. Update the data structure if needed to match your existing format
3. Ensure the formatting functions in workoutUtils.js match your data format

## Customization
To customize the styling:
1. Modify the color values in the style sections of each component
2. Adjust animation durations in the CSS
3. Update the grid layout in HistoryPage.svelte as needed

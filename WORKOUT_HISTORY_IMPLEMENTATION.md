# Workout History Implementation

## Overview
This implementation saves completed workout data to the History page after a workout is finished and the user chooses to save it.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Storage
Workout data is stored in the browser's localStorage with the key `workoutHistory`. This allows the data to persist between sessions.

### 2. Data Structure
Each workout entry in the history contains the following fields:
- `id`: Unique identifier based on timestamp
- `date`: ISO string of workout completion time
- `type`: Workout type (e.g., 'running', 'cycling')
- `duration`: Workout duration in seconds
- `distance`: Distance covered in kilometers
- `avgPace`: Average pace in seconds per kilometer
- `avgSpeed`: Average speed in km/h
- `maxSpeed`: Maximum speed in km/h
- `calories`: Calories burned
- `steps`: Number of steps taken
- `pace`: Pace in MM:SS /km format
- `elevationGain`: Elevation gain in meters (default: 0)
- `elevationLoss`: Elevation loss in meters (default: 0)
- `heartRate`: Heart rate data object with avg, max, and min values (default: 0 for all)
- `segments`: Array of workout segments with average speeds

### 3. Saving Workouts
When a workout is completed and the user clicks "Save" in the workout summary modal:
1. The [saveWorkoutToHistory](file:///e:/Developing/DevBuild/Prototype/web_app_run_svelte/Run_saraylo_app/src/components/Training.svelte#L769-L820) function is called
2. Workout data is formatted and validated
3. Existing history is loaded from localStorage
4. The new workout is added to the history array
5. The updated history is saved back to localStorage

**Note:** Previously, workouts needed to be longer than 10 minutes to be saved. This restriction has been removed, and now all workouts are saved regardless of duration.

### 4. Loading History
The History page loads workout data from localStorage when it mounts:
1. The component attempts to load data from localStorage
2. If data exists, it's parsed and displayed
3. If there's an error or no data exists, mock data is displayed as fallback

### 5. Displaying Workout Types
Workout types are displayed in Russian using a mapping function:
- 'running' → 'Бег'
- 'treadmill' → 'Бег на дорожке'
- 'cycling' → 'Велосипед'
- 'walking' → 'Ходьба'
- 'nordic_walking' → 'Скандинавская ходьба'

## Files Modified

### src/components/Training.svelte
- Contains the [saveWorkoutToHistory](file:///e:/Developing/DevBuild/Prototype/web_app_run_svelte/Run_saraylo_app/src/components/Training.svelte#L771-L822) function that saves workout data to localStorage
- Calls [saveWorkoutToHistory](file:///e:/Developing/DevBuild/Prototype/web_app_run_svelte/Run_saraylo_app/src/components/Training.svelte#L771-L822) when a workout is confirmed and saved

### src/components/History.svelte
- Loads workout history from localStorage on component mount
- Displays workout data in the "Последние тренировки" panel
- Formats workout types for proper Russian display

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Complete a workout in the Training section (workouts of any duration can now be saved)
2. Click "Save" in the workout summary modal
3. Navigate to the History page
4. The completed workout should appear in the "Последние тренировки" panel

## Future Improvements
1. Add pagination for large history datasets
2. Implement filtering and sorting options
3. Add export functionality for workout data
4. Implement cloud synchronization for workout history
5. Add real elevation and heart rate data collection
